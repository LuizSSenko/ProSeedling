## Computerized Seedling Processing for Seed Vigor Analysis

The ProSeedling software is an advanced tool developed for the analysis of soybean seeds. It features specific characteristics and innovative functions:

- **Superior Seedling Detection:**
ProSeedling is capable of detecting features of interest even with low contrast between the color of the seedling and the background. Unlike other similar software, it uses the germination paper itself to acquire images of the seedlings, ensuring high performance in evaluations.

## Minimizing Damage to Seedlings:
A major advantage of ProSeedling is its ability to minimize the handling of seedlings during the analysis process. This is important as it reduces the risk of damage to the seedlings, which can affect the accuracy of the analysis results.


## User-Friendly Interface:
The software also includes a user interface, designed with PyQT5, to facilitate user interaction with the system. This makes ProSeedling accessible not just to specialized researchers, but also to other users who may be interested in seed analysis.

## Data Processing and Analysis:
ProSeedling employs various open-source libraries for image processing and data manipulation. For instance, it uses OpenCV for image processing, Numpy and Scipy for numerical calculations, and Pandas for tabular data manipulation. This allows for comprehensive and detailed analysis of the captured images.

## Proven efficiency:
ProSeedling, still in its initial development phase, presents remarkable precision and accuracy. Compared to the Vigor-S, which already has proven efficiency for evaluating soybean seedlings, the results of the ProSeedling showed relevant consistency. However, it is essential to highlight the importance of conducting more experiments and improving settings to reach your full potential. A significant differentiator of ProSeedling is its open source nature, enabling researchers and professionals to adjust and adapt the software according to your needs. This feature expands the Future prospects for ProSeedling in the field of seed vigor assessment seeds.

# Equipment used in the project

The equipment used to capture ProSeedling images was developed for acquiring images of seedlings based on the principle of transillumination. The equipment consists of an MDF box (Figure A), the interior of which is painted matte black, in order to avoid reflections (Figure B). In the upper part of the box, at a distance of 33.5 cm from the seeds, a digital camera equipped with an 8 Mpx SONY imx179 sensor and a 100ยบ lens is positioned. This camera is fixed to a movable axis, allowing positioning adjustments (Figure B and C). At the bottom of the box, there is a mobile platform for positioning seedling samples. Complementing the set, there is a lighting system using cold white LEDs (6000k), measuring 40 x 40 cm, with a total power of 32W and an emission of 2200 lumen (Figure D).
Figure 4 shows an image of three-day-old soybean seedlings, captured using the aforementioned equipment. It is observed that the seedlings are highlighted in the image, allowing adequate segmentation of the image for the subsequent stages of software development.
