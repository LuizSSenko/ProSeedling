## Computerized Seedling Processing for Seed Vigor Analysis

The ProSeedling software is an advanced tool developed for the analysis of soybean seeds. It features specific characteristics and innovative functions:

- **Automated Seedling Image Capture:**
ProSeedling is capable of detecting features of interest even with low contrast between the color of the seedling and the background. Unlike other similar software, it uses the germination paper itself to acquire images of the seedlings, ensuring high performance in evaluations.

- **Minimizing Damage to Seedlings:**
A major advantage of ProSeedling is its ability to minimize the handling of seedlings during the analysis process. This is important as it reduces the risk of damage to the seedlings, which can affect the accuracy of the analysis results.


- **Proven efficiency:**
ProSeedling, still in its initial development phase, presents remarkable precision and accuracy. Compared to the Vigor-S, which already has proven efficiency for evaluating soybean seedlings, the results of the ProSeedling showed relevant consistency. However, it is essential to highlight the importance of conducting more experiments and improving settings to reach your full potential. A significant differentiator of ProSeedling is its open source nature, enabling researchers and professionals to adjust and adapt the software according to your needs. This feature expands the Future prospects for ProSeedling in the field of seed vigor assessment seeds.

- **Data Processing and Analysis:**
ProSeedling employs various open-source libraries for image processing and data manipulation. For instance, it uses OpenCV for image processing, Numpy and Scipy for numerical calculations, and Pandas for tabular data manipulation. This allows for comprehensive and detailed analysis of the captured images.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**
The software also includes a user interface, designed with PyQT5, to facilitate user interaction with the system. This makes ProSeedling accessible not just to specialized researchers, but also to other users who may be interested in seed analysis.
