This plataform does not allow to upload files with more than 25 mb, so i uploaded the .exe file to my personal account:

[Version 1.2]
- Changed how the program deals with 720p or lower resolution screens.
- Changed the way that the seedling editing tool works, by creating a roll zone with the image inside, instead of just the image. This mitigates the issue of cropped images, and allow the editing on low resution screens.
- Added the .csv files concatenation on the meu "files", now you dont need to use two diferent softwares to work. This function is beta, it has the graphics option coded, but commented by now, until i solve some issues.
